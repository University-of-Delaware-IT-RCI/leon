  @abstract
    Database containing paths eligible for removal.
  @discussion
    To facilitate dry-runs and pre-removal analyses of a directory, LEON does not remove content
    as it scans the filesystem.  Rather, it produces a list of directories that it deems eligible
    for removal (and renames eligible directories if this is NOT a dry-run).  Eligible paths are
    pushed to a worklog as the initial scan is performed.  When a path is pushed, all descendent
    paths already present in the worklog are removed, since removal of the parent implies removal
    of its children.
    
    If the program has not been invoked in dry-run mode, directories are purged by popping paths
    from the worklog and doing a recursive rmdir on each.
    
    Internally, the worklog is implemented as an SQLite database with a single table:
    
        CREATE TABLE worklog (
          pathId         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
          origPath       TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
          altPath        TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
        );
        
    When not in dry-run mode, LEON renames eligibile directories as it scans the filesystem in
    order to mitigate post-scan, pre-removal changes to the directory; the original directory
    name is stored in the origPath field and the renamed path in altPath.
    
    The initial filesystem scan is "wrapped" in a single database transaction to avoid repeated
    transaction cycles that would otherwise radically throttle the scan.  When the initial scan
    has completed (successfully) the leon_worklog_scanComplete() function is called to commit
    the transaction and a new transaction is begun.  A dry-run would exit at this point; otherwise,
    the worklog is replayed and directory removal performed.
